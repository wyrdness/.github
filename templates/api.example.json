      "full": "Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is a large, ape-like creature purported to inhabit the forests of North America. Described as standing 6-10 feet tall, covered in dark hair, and possessing a strong, unpleasant odor, Bigfoot has been reported by thousands of witnesses over several centuries. The phenomenon gained widespread attention in the 1950s-60s and remains one of the most actively investigated cryptids. While no conclusive physical evidence has been scientifically verified, the volume of consistent eyewitness accounts, physical traces, and cultural significance make Bigfoot a cornerstone of cryptozoological research."
