## Paranormal-Specific Guidelines

### Regarding Beliefs

Wyrdness is a space for both believers and skeptics. We ask that all participants:

- **Respect personal experiences** - Dismissing someone's encounter as "fake" without evidence is as inappropriate as insisting something is real without evidence
- **Distinguish belief from evidence** - Clearly separate personal conviction from documented facts
- **Avoid evangelizing** - Neither debunking crusades nor true-believer proselytizing are welcome
- **Acknowledge uncertainty** - Most phenomena remain unexplained; humility serves us all

### Regarding Data

- **Never fabricate** - Submitting false data undermines the entire project
- **Cite sources** - Unsourced claims should be clearly marked as such
- **Respect cultural origins** - Many phenomena come from specific cultural traditions; approach with respect
- **Protect privacy** - Never share personal information about witnesses without consent

### Regarding Sensitive Topics

Some paranormal topics involve:

- **Indigenous/Cultural traditions** (skinwalkers, wendigos, jinn) - Approach with cultural sensitivity and respect
- **Mental health** - Some experiences may relate to psychological conditions; avoid stigmatizing language
- **Trauma** - Encounters can be frightening; treat experiencers with compassion
- **Death and the afterlife** - Be respectful when discussing ghosts, NDEs, and similar topics

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban
